**Performance Reviews Summarization using LLMs**

Text summarization is the process of extracting the most important information from a text document and presenting it in a concise manner.

Summarizing employee performance reviews can help both organizations and people in a variety of ways. Summarized reviews provide a quick glimpse of an employee's performance, highlighting their accomplishments, strengths, and areas for improvement without having to go through an extensive manual evaluation. Managers and HR experts may quickly assess an employee's performance, which can help on promotions, raises, and development plans.

Using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-2, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) and others to summarize performance reviews can considerably speed up and improve the process.

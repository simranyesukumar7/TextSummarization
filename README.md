# ðŸ“Š Performance Reviews Summarization using LLMs

Text summarization involves extracting key information from a document and presenting it concisely. In this project, we focus on summarizing employee performance reviews using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as GPT-2, BERT, and BART.

Summarized reviews provide a quick overview of an employeeâ€™s strengths, achievements, and areas for improvement, enabling managers and HR professionals to assess performance efficiently, aiding decisions on promotions, raises, and development plans.
